# Northcoders Final Project

## Part-Time Pet :dog: :rabbit: :cat:

### Description

Part-Time Pet is a mobile application that uses our [Part-Time Pet API](https://github.com/nathanielpells/nc-project-api) and firebase. It was built by myself and four others as part of our final project of the Northcoders bootcamp.

### Part-Time Pet's Functionality

Making calls to the API, the app allows the user the following functionality:

- Add a new user.
- Add pets to their profile.
- Delete pets.
- Edit pets.
- Add reviews.
- Delete reviews.
- Access a list of all pets.
- Filter pets by distance from them.
- Sort pets by breed.
- Search pets with search bar.
- Instant message other users.
